# Wordle helper

This project contains a working wordle game where an algorithm suggests words that you can play to help you.

To play the game run the `Wordle.py` file.

To test the average game score of the algorithm, run the `AI.py` file.

The tested score of the AI is around `5.531` guesses on average where a lost game is counted as 7 guesses

The word files where downloaded from `https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a7b776506c73284511034e63af1017ee` and are the 'official' new york times wordle answers and allowed guesses.
